## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

Get LogSentinel up and running in 5 minutes.

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/Nguyen-Thuan-Chi/LogSentinel.git](https://github.com/Nguyen-Thuan-Chi/LogSentinel.git)
cd LogSentinel
```

**2. Restore & Build**
```bash
dotnet restore
dotnet build
```

**3. Configure the Database**

The project uses SQLite by default. No configuration is needed. To use SQL Server, update the connection string in `appsettings.json`.

**4. Run Migrations**

The application automatically applies migrations on startup. Alternatively, you can run them manually:
```bash
dotnet ef database update --project LogSentinel.DAL
```

**5. Run the Application**
```bash
dotnet run --project "Log Sentinel"
```
Or simply press **F5** in Visual Studio.

## üìñ Usage Guide

- **Dashboard**: Get an at-a-glance view of system health, recent alerts, and event trends.
- **Events View**: Browse, search, and filter all ingested events. Right-click on an event for context actions.
- **Rules View**: Manage all detection rules. Enable/disable, edit YAML definitions, and test rules against events.

## üõ†Ô∏è For Developers & Contributors

We welcome contributions! Here's how to get started.

### Project Structure

The solution is organized into three main projects: `LogSentinel.UI`, `LogSentinel.BUS` (Business Logic), and `LogSentinel.DAL` (Data Access).

### Creating a Custom Rule

1.  Create a new `.yml` file in `LogSentinel.DAL/Data/Rules/`.
2.  Define the `selection`, `condition`, and `action` for your rule.
    ```yaml
    name: New Admin User Created
    description: Detects when a new user is added to a privileged group.
    severity: Medium
    enabled: true
    selection:
      event_id: 4732
    condition:
      # No specific condition needed, the event itself is the trigger
      count: 1
      timeframe: 60
    action:
      alert: true
      title: "Admin User '{user}' Created"
      description: "A new user '{user}' was added to the Administrators group."
    ```
3.  The application will automatically load the new rule on startup.

### Contribution Workflow

1.  **Fork** the repository.
2.  Create a new feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourAmazingFeature`).
3.  Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'feat: Add some AmazingFeature'`).
4.  Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourAmazingFeature`).
5.  Open a **Pull Request**.

---

## üì¶ Deployment

### Standalone (SQLite)

1.  Publish the application as a self-contained executable:
    ```bash
    dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained
    ```
2.  Copy the output from `bin\Release\net9.0-windows\win-x64\publish\`.
3.  Ensure the application has write permissions to the `data/` folder.

### Enterprise (SQL Server)

1.  Create a new database in your SQL Server instance.
2.  Update the `DefaultConnection` in `appsettings.Production.json` with your SQL Server connection string.
3.  Deploy the published application files to your server.

## üìù Sample Rules Included

| Rule Name                 | Event ID | Description                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Failed Login Threshold** | 4625     | 5+ failed logins from the same user in 5 minutes.      |
| **Admin User Created** | 4732     | A user was added to the local Administrators group.    |
| **Suspicious PowerShell** | -        | Detects PowerShell commands with obfuscation flags.    |
| **Privilege Escalation** | 4672     | Special privileges assigned to a new logon.            |
| **Event Log Cleared** | 1102     | The Security event log was cleared.                    |
| **New Service Installed** | 7045     | A new service was installed on the system.             |
| **Account Lockout** | 4740     | A user account was locked out.                         |

## ü§î Troubleshooting

-   **Issue: Database is locked.**
    -   **Solution**: This is a limitation of SQLite. Ensure only one instance of the application is running.
-   **Issue: Events are not appearing.**
    -   **Solution**: Check that the log file directory exists and that the application has the necessary read/write permissions. Review the application logs in the `logs/` directory for errors.
-   **Issue: A rule is not triggering.**
    -   **Solution**: In the Rules View, ensure the rule is enabled. Use a YAML validator to check your rule's syntax. Use the "Test Rule" feature against a known matching event.
