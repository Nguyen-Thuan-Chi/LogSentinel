Write-Host "? IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "  1. Created RuleEngineService.cs with dynamic YAML processing"
Write-Host "  2. Replaced hardcoded if-else logic with ProcessEventAsync method"
Write-Host "  3. Implemented DoesEventMatchRule for key-value detection"
Write-Host "  4. Updated service registration in App.xaml.cs"
Write-Host "  5. Added sample YAML rules with simplified format"

Write-Host "?? KEY FEATURES IMPLEMENTED:" -ForegroundColor Magenta
Write-Host "  ? Dynamic rule loading from database (GetEnabledAsync)"
Write-Host "  ? YAML parsing using YamlDotNet"
Write-Host "  ? log_source validation (provider + event_id)"
Write-Host "  ? detection section processing (key-value AND conditions)"
Write-Host "  ? Case-insensitive string comparison"
Write-Host "  ? JSON DetailsJson parsing and matching"
Write-Host "  ? Alert creation with rule information"
Write-Host "  ? Rule trigger statistics update"
Write-Host "  ? Comprehensive error handling and logging"

Write-Host "?? TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:" -ForegroundColor Blue
Write-Host "  ? ProcessEventAsync: Main entry point replacing hardcoded logic"
Write-Host "  ? DoesEventMatchRule: Core dynamic matching logic"
Write-Host "  ? YamlDotNet: YAML to Dictionary<string, object> parsing"
Write-Host "  ? System.Text.Json: Event DetailsJson parsing"
Write-Host "  ? Case-insensitive matching for all string comparisons"
Write-Host "  ? Exception handling for robust operation"

Write-Host "?? SAMPLE RULES ADDED TO SEED DATA:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "  1. Notepad Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1)"
Write-Host "  2. Calculator Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1)"
Write-Host "  3. PowerShell Process Creation (Sysmon Event ID 1)"
Write-Host "  4. Command Prompt Execution (Sysmon Event ID 1)"
Write-Host "  5. Network Connection to External IP (Sysmon Event ID 3)"
Write-Host "  6. Admin User Logon (Security Event ID 4624)"

Write-Host "?? UNIT TESTS CREATED:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "  ? RuleEngineServiceTests.cs with comprehensive test coverage"
Write-Host "  ? Tests for YAML parsing, rule matching, and alert generation"
Write-Host "  ? Tests for case-insensitive matching and multiple criteria"
Write-Host "  ? Tests for negative cases (wrong provider, event ID, values)"

Write-Host "?? HOW TO USE:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "  1. Build and run the application"
Write-Host "  2. Navigate to Rules view to see the new simplified rules"
Write-Host "  3. Create new rules using the target YAML format"
Write-Host "  4. Events matching the detection criteria will trigger alerts"
Write-Host "  5. Check Alerts view for generated alerts"
