# LogSentinel Demo Guide

This guide walks you through a complete demonstration of LogSentinel's capabilities, from initial setup to detecting security threats.

## ?? Demo Scenario Overview

We'll demonstrate:
1. Application startup and database seeding
2. Real-time event ingestion
3. Rule-based threat detection
4. Alert generation and acknowledgment
5. Event search and filtering
6. Alert export capabilities

**Estimated Time:** 15 minutes

---

## ?? Prerequisites

Before starting the demo, ensure:
- [ ] .NET 9 SDK installed
- [ ] LogSentinel built successfully (`dotnet build`)
- [ ] No other instances of LogSentinel running
- [ ] `sample-logs/incoming/` directory exists

---

## ?? Step-by-Step Demo

### Step 1: Clean Start (Optional)

For a fresh demo, delete the existing database:

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
Remove-Item "Log Sentinel\data\logsentinel.db" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item "Log Sentinel\logs\*" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### Step 2: Launch LogSentinel

```bash
cd "Log Sentinel"
dotnet run
```

**Expected Output:**
```
[14:30:00 INF] Using SQLite database: Data Source=./data/logsentinel.db
[14:30:01 INF] Database seeded successfully
[14:30:01 INF] Loaded 10 rules
[14:30:01 INF] Rule engine initialized
[14:30:01 INF] Watching directory: ./sample-logs/incoming
[14:30:02 INF] LogSentinel application started successfully
```

**UI Should Show:**
- Dashboard with seeded events (500 synthetic events)
- Event counts: Total, Warnings, Errors
- Empty alerts (recent 5 minutes)

### Step 3: Verify Seeded Data

Navigate to **Events View**:
- You should see 500 pre-loaded events
- Events have various levels: Info, Warning, Error, Critical
- Events span the last 7 days

**Screenshot Checklist:**
? Events grid populated
? Multiple hosts visible (WEB-SERVER-01, DB-SERVER-01, etc.)
? Timestamp sorting works

### Step 4: Generate a Failed Login Attack

Open a new PowerShell window and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to project root
cd "Log Sentinel"

# Generate failed login events
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
$attackEvents = @(
    "$timestamp [ERROR] DC-01 attacker lsass.exe Failed login attempt (Event ID: 4625)",
    "$((Get-Date).AddSeconds(10).ToString('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')) [ERROR] DC-01 attacker lsass.exe Failed login attempt (Event ID: 4625)",
    "$((Get-Date).AddSeconds(20).ToString('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')) [ERROR] DC-01 attacker lsass.exe Failed login attempt (Event ID: 4625)",
    "$((Get-Date).AddSeconds(30).ToString('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')) [ERROR] DC-01 attacker lsass.exe Failed login attempt (Event ID: 4625)",
    "$((Get-Date).AddSeconds(40).ToString('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss')) [ERROR] DC-01 attacker lsass.exe Failed login attempt (Event ID: 4625)"
)

$attackEvents | Out-File "sample-logs\incoming\attack-failed-logins.log" -Encoding UTF8

Write-Host "? Attack scenario injected!" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Watch LogSentinel for alerts..." -ForegroundColor Yellow
```

**Expected Behavior:**
1. LogSentinel detects the new file
2. Imports 5 failed login events
3. Rule engine evaluates events
4. **Alert Created**: "Multiple Failed Logins for attacker"

**In the UI:**
- Navigate to **Dashboard** Å® Recent Alerts section
- You should see a new HIGH severity alert
- Title: "Multiple Failed Logins"
- Rule: "Failed Login Threshold"

**In the Logs:**
```
[14:35:22 INF] Imported 5 events from attack-failed-logins.log
[14:35:22 WRN] Alert created: Multiple Failed Logins (Severity: High)
```

### Step 5: Investigate the Alert

1. Click on the alert in the **Recent Alerts** panel
2. View details:
   - Rule Name: Failed Login Threshold
   - Severity: High
   - Affected User: attacker
   - Event Count: 5
   - Timeframe: Last 5 minutes

3. Acknowledge the alert:
   - Click "Acknowledge" button
   - Enter your name (e.g., "Security Admin")
   - Alert status changes to "Acknowledged"

### Step 6: Search for Related Events

1. Navigate to **Events View**
2. Use the search box: Enter `attacker`
3. Results should show all 5 failed login events
4. Filter by Event ID: `4625`
5. Verify all failed logins are visible

### Step 7: Test Suspicious PowerShell Rule

Generate a suspicious PowerShell event:

```powershell
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
$powershellAttack = "$timestamp [WARNING] WORKSTATION-42 eve powershell.exe Suspicious command: powershell.exe -NoP -W Hidden -Enc aGVsbG8gd29ybGQ="

$powershellAttack | Out-File "sample-logs\incoming\attack-powershell.log" -Encoding UTF8

Write-Host "? PowerShell attack injected!" -ForegroundColor Green
```

**Expected Alert:**
- Rule: "Suspicious PowerShell Execution"
- Severity: High
- Title: "Suspicious PowerShell Command"
- Process: powershell.exe

### Step 8: Test Admin User Creation Rule

Generate an admin user creation event:

```powershell
$timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
$adminEvent = "$timestamp [CRITICAL] DC-01 admin cmd.exe User 'hacker' added to Administrators group (Event ID: 4732)"

$adminEvent | Out-File "sample-logs\incoming\attack-admin-create.log" -Encoding UTF8

Write-Host "? Admin creation attack injected!" -ForegroundColor Red
```

**Expected Alert:**
- Rule: "Admin User Created"
- Severity: Critical
- Title: "Admin Account Created"
- Event ID: 4732

### Step 9: Export Alerts

1. Navigate to **Rules View** (or use menu)
2. Click **Export** button
3. Choose format: **JSON** or **CSV**
4. Save to: `exports/alerts-export.json`

**Verify Export:**
```powershell
Get-Content "exports\alerts-export.json" | ConvertFrom-Json | Format-Table
```

Should show all generated alerts with details.

### Step 10: Continuous Monitoring (Optional)

For continuous demo:

```powershell
# Generate events every 5 seconds
.\scripts\Generate-SyntheticLogs.ps1 -Continuous
```

**Watch:**
- Events appear in real-time in Events View
- Dashboard counters update live
- Occasional alerts trigger (based on generated patterns)

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

## ?? Advanced Demo Scenarios

### Scenario A: Batch Import Performance

Test with large dataset:

```powershell
# Generate 10,000 events
.\scripts\Generate-SyntheticLogs.ps1 -EventCount 10000

# Measure import time
Measure-Command {
    # Copy to incoming folder
    Copy-Item "sample-logs\*.log" "sample-logs\incoming\"
}

# Typical: 2-5 seconds for 10K events
```

### Scenario B: Database Switch to SQL Server

1. Install SQL Server (if not already)
2. Create database:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE LogSentinel;
   ```
3. Update `appsettings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "ConnectionStrings": {
       "DefaultConnection": "Server=LAPTOP-PN16MELH;Database=LogSentinel;Integrated Security=True;TrustServerCertificate=True;"
     }
   }
   ```
4. Restart LogSentinel
5. Check logs: `[INF] Using SQL Server database`

### Scenario C: Custom Rule Creation

1. Navigate to **Rules View**
2. Click **Create New Rule**
3. Enter YAML:
   ```yaml
   name: Custom Disk Space Alert
   description: Alert when disk space message appears
   severity: Medium
   enabled: true
   selection:
     level: WARNING
   condition:
     pattern: "(?i)disk space"
     field: details_json
   action:
     alert: true
     title: "Low Disk Space on {host}"
     description: "Disk space warning detected"
   ```
4. Save rule
5. Generate matching event:
   ```powershell
   $timestamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss"
   "$timestamp [WARNING] SERVER-01 system diskmonitor.exe Disk space running low on C:" | 
     Out-File "sample-logs\incoming\disk-alert.log"
   ```
6. Verify alert appears

### Scenario D: Webhook Integration

1. Setup test webhook receiver:
   ```powershell
   # Simple HTTP listener (for testing)
   Start-Process "https://webhook.site" # Get unique URL
   ```
2. Update `appsettings.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "LogSentinel": {
       "AlertWebhookUrl": "https://webhook.site/your-unique-id"
     }
   }
   ```
3. Trigger any alert
4. Check webhook.site for received payload

## ?? Demo Script (Verbal)

Use this script when presenting:

> "Good morning! Today I'll demonstrate LogSentinel, a security event monitoring system. 
>
> **[Launch App]**  
> As you can see, the app starts up and automatically seeds the database with 500 sample events from the past week. We're using SQLite for this demo, but it supports SQL Server for enterprise deployments.
>
> **[Show Dashboard]**  
> The dashboard gives us an overview: today's events, recent alerts, and trends. Currently quiet.
>
> **[Navigate to Events]**  
> Here's our events view with full-text search. Let me filter by host... see, we have events from multiple servers.
>
> **[Inject Attack]**  
> Now, let's simulate an attack. I'm injecting 5 failed login attempts within 1 minute.  
> **[Wait 2 seconds]**  
> And... there it is! High-severity alert for 'Multiple Failed Logins'. The rule engine detected the pattern automatically.
>
> **[Show Alert Details]**  
> Clicking the alert shows affected user, event count, and timeline. I can acknowledge it here.
>
> **[Inject PowerShell Attack]**  
> Let's try another. Suspicious PowerShell with encoded commands... alert triggered immediately.
>
> **[Show Rules View]**  
> All rules are defined in YAML?easy to read and modify. We have 10 pre-built rules covering common threats.
>
> **[Export Demo]**  
> Finally, I can export these alerts to JSON or CSV, or configure webhooks to send to Splunk, Elastic, etc.
>
> That's LogSentinel?real-time threat detection made simple. Questions?"
