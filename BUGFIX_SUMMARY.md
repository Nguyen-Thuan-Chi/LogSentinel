# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Race Condition in ViewModel Constructors**
**Problem:** ViewModels were using `Task.Run()` in their constructors to load data asynchronously, which could cause race conditions and exceptions when the UI tried to access data before it was ready.

**Files Fixed:**
- `Log Sentinel\ViewModels\AlertsViewModel.cs`
- `Log Sentinel\ViewModels\DashboardViewModel.cs`
- `Log Sentinel\ViewModels\RuleViewModel.cs`

**Solution:** Changed from `Task.Run()` to `Application.Current.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync()` to ensure async operations run on the UI thread and don't block the constructor.

```csharp
// Before (WRONG):
Task.Run(async () => await LoadAlertsAsync());

// After (CORRECT):
_ = System.Windows.Application.Current.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(async () => await LoadAlertsAsync());
```

### 2. **Service Lifetime Mismatch**
**Problem:** ViewModels were registered as Singletons but were injecting Scoped services (repositories), causing "Cannot resolve scoped service from root provider" exceptions.

**File Fixed:**
- `Log Sentinel\App.xaml.cs`

**Solution:** Changed ViewModel registrations from `AddSingleton` to `AddTransient` for ViewModels that require scoped services:

```csharp
// Before:
services.AddSingleton<DashboardViewModel>();
services.AddSingleton<RuleViewModel>();
services.AddSingleton<AlertsViewModel>();

// After:
services.AddTransient<DashboardViewModel>();
services.AddTransient<RuleViewModel>();
services.AddTransient<AlertsViewModel>();
```

### 3. **Improper Scope Management in Views**
**Problem:** Views were getting ViewModels from the root service provider without creating proper scopes, leading to scoped service resolution issues.

**Files Fixed:**
- `Log Sentinel\UI\AlertsView.xaml.cs`
- `Log Sentinel\UI\DashboardView.xaml.cs`
- `Log Sentinel\UI\RuleView.xaml.cs`
- `Log Sentinel\UI\EventsView.xaml.cs`

**Solution:** Created proper service scopes when instantiating ViewModels:

```csharp
// Before:
DataContext = app.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<AlertsViewModel>();

// After:
var scope = app.ServiceProvider.CreateScope();
DataContext = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<AlertsViewModel>();
```

---

### 4. **Missing Dependency Injection in EventsView**
**Problem:** EventsView was creating its ViewModel manually without using dependency injection, missing the service provider context.

**File Fixed:**
- `Log Sentinel\UI\EventsView.xaml.cs`

**Solution:** Updated to use dependency injection with proper scope management and fallback for design-time:

```csharp
// Before:
_viewModel = new EventsViewModel();

// After:
if (Application.Current is App app)
{
    var scope = app.ServiceProvider.CreateScope();
    var viewModel = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<EventsViewModel>();
    DataContext = viewModel;
}
else
{
    // Fallback for design-time
    var viewModel = new EventsViewModel();
    DataContext = viewModel;
}
```

## Root Causes

The main issues were:

1. **Async/Await Anti-patterns**: Using `Task.Run()` in constructors instead of proper async initialization
2. **DI Lifetime Issues**: Mixing singleton and scoped service lifetimes incorrectly
3. **Missing Scope Management**: Not creating proper service scopes when resolving scoped services
4. **Threading Issues**: Not ensuring UI operations happen on the UI thread

## Testing Recommendations

After these fixes, you should test:

1. ? Application startup without exceptions
2. ? Navigation between all views (Dashboard, Rules, Events, Alerts, Settings)
3. ? Data loading in each view
4. ? Alert notifications appearing correctly
5. ? No memory leaks from improper scope management

## Build Status

? **Build Successful** - All files compile without errors.
