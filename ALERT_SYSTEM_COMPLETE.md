# LogSentinel Alert System - Implementation Summary

## ?? COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. DATABASE SCHEMA ?
- **Alert Entity**: Complete alert model with severity, timestamps, acknowledgment
- **Rule Entity**: YAML-based rule definitions with enable/disable capability  
- **Migration**: `AddAlertsAndRules` successfully applied
- **Relationships**: Foreign key between Alerts and Rules

### 2. REPOSITORIES & DATA ACCESS ?
- **AlertRepository**: Full CRUD operations, filtering by severity/date
- **RuleRepository**: Rule management with status toggling
- **Integration**: Proper dependency injection and scoped services

### 3. RULE ENGINE ?
- **Real-time Processing**: Events evaluated against all active rules
- **YAML Rule Definitions**: Flexible rule conditions and patterns
- **Pattern Matching**: Regex support for complex event matching
- **Threshold Rules**: Count-based rules with time windows
- **Group By Support**: Rules can group by user, host, process

### 4. ALERT SERVICE ?
- **Alert Creation**: Automatic alert generation when rules trigger
- **Event Tracking**: Links alerts to triggering events with metadata
- **Acknowledgment**: User can acknowledge alerts with notes
- **Export Functions**: CSV and JSON export capabilities
- **Webhook Support**: HTTP notifications for external systems

### 5. USER INTERFACE ENHANCEMENTS ?

#### Events View - FIXED ?
- **Source Filter Fix**: ComboBox binding issue resolved with `SelectedValuePath="Content"`
- **Real-time Filtering**: Works with All, Sample, Sysmon, System, WindowsEventLog
- **Search Functionality**: Multi-field search across all event properties
- **Live Updates**: Events appear in real-time from EventImporter

#### Alerts View - ENHANCED ?
- **Severity Indicators**: Color-coded severity badges
- **Action Buttons**: Acknowledge, View Details, Delete for each alert
- **Bulk Operations**: Acknowledge All, Export CSV
- **Status Tracking**: Shows acknowledged vs new alerts
- **Real-time Updates**: New alerts appear immediately

#### Rules View - FUNCTIONAL ?
- **Rule Management**: View all rules with status and statistics
- **Trigger Counters**: Shows how many times each rule triggered
- **Enable/Disable**: Toggle rule status dynamically

### 6. SAMPLE SECURITY RULES ?
1. **Failed Login Threshold**: Detects multiple failed logins (Event ID 4625)
2. **Admin User Created**: Critical alert for admin privilege escalation (Event ID 4732)
3. **Suspicious PowerShell**: Detects PowerShell with malicious flags
4. **Process Creation Monitoring**: Tracks new processes from Sysmon
5. **Network Connection Monitoring**: Monitors network connections

### 7. INTEGRATION & SERVICES ?
- **EventImporter Integration**: Each event processed through Rule Engine
- **Service Registration**: All new services properly registered in DI container
- **Background Processing**: Rule evaluation runs asynchronously
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

   Sysmon         Filtering      Matching    Storage   Management
```

### Database Tables
```sql
Events (existing) - Raw event data
Rules - YAML rule definitions
Alerts - Generated alerts with metadata
```

### Rule YAML Format
```yaml
name: Rule Name
description: What this rule detects
severity: High|Medium|Low|Critical
enabled: true
selection:
  event_id: 4625
  source: Sysmon
condition:
  count: 5
  timeframe: 300
  group_by: user
  pattern: "(?i)(suspicious|malware)"
```

### Service Flow
1. **Rule Loading**: Rules loaded on startup from database
2. **Event Processing**: Each event evaluated against all active rules
3. **Pattern Matching**: Regex and field matching for rule conditions
4. **Threshold Evaluation**: Time-based counting for repeated events
5. **Alert Generation**: Create alert when rule matches
6. **UI Notification**: Real-time alert display and management

## ?? TESTING COMPLETED

### Source Filter Fix ?
- ComboBox binding issue resolved
- All source filters work correctly
- Real-time filtering functional

### Search Functionality ?
- Multi-field search implemented
- Case-insensitive searching
- Real-time results as user types

### Rule Engine ?
- Sample rules trigger correctly
- Alert generation working
- Rule statistics updating

### Alert Management ?
- Alert acknowledgment functional
- Bulk operations working
- Export features implemented

## ?? USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

### 1. Start Application
```bash
# Run as Administrator for full Windows Event Log access
Start LogSentinel
```

### 2. Test Source Filtering
- Go to Events view
- Try different source filters (All, Sysmon, System, etc.)
- Verify events filter correctly

### 3. Test Search
- Type in search box (Process, DNS, Info, etc.)
- Verify real-time filtering works

### 4. Generate Test Alerts
```powershell
# Run the event generator to trigger rules
.\Test-EventGenerator.ps1 -TriggerAlerts
```

### 5. Manage Alerts
- Go to Alerts view
- Acknowledge alerts
- Try filtering by severity
- Export to CSV
